For any point on the unit circle with central angle , we can simplify our trig ratios using to:    The unit circle. Special angles are marked in degrees and radians, and on the circle the ratios corresponding to that angle are given as coordinate pairs.    Let's use the unit circle to find some trig values:                                         undefined     "
